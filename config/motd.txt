<br><font color=blue>Welcome!</font>
<br>A few things before you dive into this server:
<br>♦ This server holds no rules. The only rule we got is that extremely offensive material will get removed or when you start spamming the chat.
<br>♦ The station runs on modified Baycode
<br>♦ AdminHelp and AdminWho are disabled, we have no game moderators.
<br>♦ We are actively working on the server, this means you can expect (sudden) restarts or periods of downtime.
<br>♦ Do you know how to script for SS13? Feel free to add neat functions to our server by visiting our github!
<br>
<br>Because all the cool kids do it, we have a forum in which you may share your stories, plead for Funimator position or whatever.
<br>I tried to make the forum as accessible as possible so now you can simply register a account by logging in with your Steam account.
